## Chunk 1
**Tic-Tac-Toe Game Documentation**

**Overview**
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple text-based game that allows two players to play against each other. The game uses the classic 3x3 grid format where "x" and "o" are used to represent the players.

**Functions**

### `__init__(user)`

 Initializes the Tic-Tac-Toe game with a given user ("x" or "o").

#### Request:

* `user`: A string representing the initial player ("x" or "o").

#### Response:

No response is expected. The game initialization occurs internally.

### `initialize_board()`

Initializes an empty 3x3 grid to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

#### Request:

None

#### Response:

The initialized board is stored internally, with all cells set to "-" (empty).

### `show_board()`

Displays the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

#### Request:

None

#### Response:

The board is printed to the console, with each row representing a cell on the board. Cells are represented by either "x", "o", or "-".

### `is_board_filled()`

Checks if the Tic-Tac-Toe board is completely filled (i.e., all cells contain either "x" or "o").

#### Request:

None

#### Response:

A boolean value indicating whether the board is fully filled.

### `check_winner()`

Checks for a winner on the Tic-Tac-Toe board by examining rows, columns, and diagonals for three consecutive identical cells (either "x" or "o").

#### Request:

None

#### Response:

A boolean value indicating whether there is a winner.

### `place_piece(row, column)`

Places a player's piece ("x" or "o") on the specified cell of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

#### Request:

* `row`: An integer representing the row index (0-2).
* `column`: An integer representing the column index (0-2).

#### Response:

The game updates the board accordingly, and if the move results in a win, it prints the winning message and exits the game loop. Otherwise, it prompts the next player to make their move.

### `switch_players()`

Switches the current player from "x" to "o" or vice versa.

#### Request:

None

#### Response:

The internal state of the player is updated.

### `start_game()`

Starts a new game and begins the gameplay loop.

#### Request:

None

#### Response:

The game initializes, and players take turns making moves. The game continues until there is a winner or the board is completely filled (resulting in a tie).

**Endpoints**

There are no endpoints defined for this game, as it is a text-based interactive application.

**Error Handling**
If an invalid input is provided (e.g., non-integer values), the game prints an error message and prompts the player to try again.

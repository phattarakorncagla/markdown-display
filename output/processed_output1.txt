Okay, so I need to figure out what the capital of France is. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember from school that France is a country in Western Europe. The capital city is an important place because it's where the government is located and where many official decisions are made.

Wait, do I recall any famous landmarks or structures in France? Oh yeah, the Eiffel Tower! That's in Paris, isn't it? And there's also the Louvre Museum, which I think is one of the biggest art museums in the world. So if those are in Paris, maybe that's a clue.

I should double-check my facts to make sure I'm not confusing France with another country. Sometimes countries have multiple capitals or cities that share responsibilities, but I believe most countries have just one official capital. For example, Washington D.C. is the capital of the United States, London for the UK, and Tokyo for Japan.

So, putting it all together: France's capital is Paris. It's a city rich in history, culture, and famous landmarks. I think that's correct, but maybe I should look up some sources to confirm just to be sure. But from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.
